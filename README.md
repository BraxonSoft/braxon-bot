# New Features!

### Tech

Braxon Bot uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [VBCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [node.js] - Evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - The streaming build system
* [jQuery] - Duh, you should get to know us!
* [python](https://www.python.org/) -Nnot really sure on this one, but we will let you know after we eat our cookies

And of course Braxon Bot itself is open source with a [public repository][braxon-bot]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Braxon Bot requires [Discord](https://discord.gg) to run. Preferably the latest version.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server are right here for you to clone in our repo.

```sh
https://github.com/BraxonSoft/braxon-bot.git
```
Once imported onto your desktop or an IDE of your choice, head into:
```sh
braxon-bot/data/settings.json and fill in the lines with your own Server Credentials like you see as IE below
```
```sh
{"token":"ADD YOUR OWN TOKEN - SEE README.MD","client":"ADD YOUR OWN CLIENTID - SEE README.MD","tag":"!","case":"true","separator":"\\s+","ownerId":"ADD YOUR OWN DISCORD ID - SEE README.MD"}
```


### For production environments, developers and contributors...

You could use either a notepad or [VBCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which we do prefer. IF you have Discord Bot, you can import the project from there too and start working on your own from there.

Braxon Bot will be extended with the following plugins that Braxonsoft and its [contributors] add. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.
